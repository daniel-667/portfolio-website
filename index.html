            <h1>DANIEL AVILA</h1>
            <p>U.S. Air Force veteran with over ten years of work experience transitioning into the cybersecurity field. Currently, I am a cybersecurity student passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to improve digital safety. During my six years in the United States Air Force, I served as a 2A373N Tactical Aircraft Maintenance Craftsman, specializing in maintaining the F-16 Fighting Falcon. I held various roles within my specialty, including aircraft maintenance technician, emergency responder, facility manager, equipment custodian, program manager, and IT asset manager. I participated in the ServiceNow NextGen SkillBridge program during my last six months of active duty, during which I gained in-depth knowledge of the ServiceNow platform and developed skills in service portal fundamentals, JavaScript, and application development. This diverse experience has equipped me with the confidence to learn new skills and expand my knowledge across multiple fields. In these roles, I have demonstrated expertise in information assurance, incident response, and teamwork, consistently handling complex and dynamic situations professionally and precisely.</p>
